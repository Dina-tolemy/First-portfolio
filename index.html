           Iam Dina, I graduated from faculty of Computer science and Information Systems ,Department of information systems 
           in Egypt in 2007.<br>
           </p>
        <p>   
            After that I got a scholarship in Software development at the information technology institute  in  Egypt
            in 2008.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I started a family after that and started moving between countries for a few years.<br>
          I gave my family all of my attention after that;
          I have two beautiful children a daughter and a boy.
           <br><br>
            I spend most of my time with
          them or doing voulnteer work at there school.
          <p>
          Now that they don't need me that much, 
          and we are finally settling.</p>
          <p> I started pursuing my career again by joining a bootcamp,
           so, I can refresh my knowledge and practice programing again.
